You cannot post this on the forum or they will block this loophole.

If you are willing to cheat on the use of javascript, then this works on Desktop and web mobile to jump to a spot on a form

Make an Application Variable called say [Javascript Words] and leave it blank.  

Then a URL formula Button 

[javascript words] & ":void(window.location.href='#Delivery');"

Then you make an anchor tag Formula Rich text field and put it on the form down near where you want to jump to.

"<a name=Delivery></a>"

In that example I'm jumping to an anchor tag called Delivery.

Then go back into The Application Variable and put in the word javascript.

So the idea is  that if the user lands on the top of the long form and wants to navigate miles down to the bottom they click a quick link button at the top of the form to reposition instantly to a jump target without refreshing the page.  It's instant.
